#ifndef BX_SIM_INTERFACE_H
#define BX_SIM_INTERFACE_H

//
// Intro to siminterface by Bryce Denney:
//
// Before I can describe what this file is for, I have to make the
// distinction between a configuration interface (CI) and the VGA display
// window (VGAW).  I will try to avoid the term 'GUI' because it is unclear
// if that means CI or VGAW, and because not all interfaces are graphical
// anyway.
//
// The traditional Bochs screen is a window with a large VGA display panel and
// a series of buttons (floppy, cdrom, snapshot, power).  Over the years, we
// have collected many implementations of the VGAW for different environments
// and platforms; each implementation is in a separate file under gui/*:
// x.cc, win32.cc, macintosh.cc, etc.  The files gui.h and gui.cc
// define the platform independent part of the VGAW, leaving about 15 methods
// of the bx_gui_c class undefined.  The platform dependent file must
// implement the remaining 15 methods.
//
// The configuration interface is relatively new, started by Bryce Denney in
// June 2001.  The CI is intended to allow the user to edit a variety of
// configuration and runtime options.  Some options, such as memory size or
// enabling the ethernet card, should only be changed before the simulation
// begins; others, such as floppy disk image, instructions per second, and
// logging options can be safely changed at runtime.  The CI allows the user to
// make these changes.  Before the CI existed, only a few things could be
// changed at runtime, all linked to clicking on the VGAW buttons.
//
// At the time that the CI was conceived, we were still debating what form the
// user interface part would take: stdin/stdout menus, a graphical application
// with menus and dialogs running in a separate thread, or even a tiny web
// server that you can connect to with a web browser.  As a result the
// interface to the CI was designed so that the user interface of the CI
// could be replaced easily at compile time, or maybe even at runtime via
// a plugin architecture.  To this end, we kept a clear separation between
// the user interface code and the siminterface, the code that interfaces with
// the simulator.  The same siminterface is used all the time, while
// different implementations of the CI can be switched in reasonably easily.
// Only the CI code uses library specific graphics and I/O functions; the
// siminterface deals in portable abstractions and callback functions.
// The first CI implementation was a series of text mode menus implemented in
// textconfig.cc.
//
// The configuration interface MUST use the siminterface methods to access the
// simulator.  It should not modify settings in some device with code like
// bx_floppy.s.media[2].heads = 17.  If such access is needed, then a
// siminterface method should be written to make the change on the CI's behalf.
// This separation is enforced by the fact that the CI does not even include
// bochs.h.  You'll notice that textconfig.cc includes osdep.h, paramtree.h
// and siminterface.h, so it doesn't know what bx_floppy or bx_cpu_c are.
// I'm sure some people will say is overly restrictive and/or annoying.  When I
// set it up this way, we were still talking about making the CI in a seperate
// process, where direct method calls would be impossible.  Also, we have been
// considering turning devices into plugin modules which are dynamically
// linked.  Any direct references to something like bx_floppy.s.media[2].heads
// would have to be reworked before a plugin interface was possible as well.
//
// The siminterface is the glue between the CI and the simulator.  There is
// just one global instance of the siminterface object, which can be referred
// to by the global variable bx_simulator_interface_c *SIM.  The base class
// bx_simulator_interface_c, contains only virtual functions and it defines the
// interface that the CI is allowed to use.  In siminterface.cc, a class
// called bx_real_sim_c is defined with bx_simulator_interface_c as its parent
// class.  Bx_real_sim_c implements each of the functions.  The separation into
// parent class and child class leaves the possibility of making a different
// child class that talks to the simulator in a different way (networking for
// example).  If you were writing a user interface in a separate process, you
// could define a subclass of bx_simulator_interface_c called
// bx_siminterface_proxy_c which opens up a network port and turns all method
// calls into network sends and receives.  Because the interface is defined
// entirely by the base class, the code that calls the methods would not know
// the difference.
//
// An important part of the siminterface implementation is the use of parameter
// classes, or bx_param_*.  The parameter classes are described below, where
// they are declared.  Search for "parameter classes" below for details.
//
// Also this header file declares data structures for certain events that pass
// between the siminterface and the CI.  Search for "event structures" below.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// event structures for communication between simulator and CI
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Because the CI (configuration interface) might be in a different
// thread or even a different process, we pass events encoded in data
// structures to it instead of just calling functions.  Each type of
// event is declared as a different structure, and then all those
// structures are squished into a union in BxEvent.  (BTW, this is
// almost exactly how X windows event structs work.)
//
// These are simple structs, unblemished by C++ methods and tricks.
// No matter what event type it is, we allocate a BxEvent for each
// one, as opposed to trying to save a few bytes on small events by
// allocating only the bytes necessary for it.  This makes it easy and
// fast to store events in a queue, like this
//   BxEvent event_queue[MAX_EVENTS];
//
// Events come in two varieties: synchronous and asynchronous.  We
// have to worry about sync and async events because the CI and the
// simulation may be running in different threads.  An async event is
// the simplest.  Whichever thread originates the event just builds
// the data structure, sends it, and then continues with its business.
// Async events can go in either direction.  Synchronous events
// require the other thread to "respond" before the originating thread
// can continue.  It's like a function with a return value; you can't
// continue until you get the return value back.
//
// Examples:
//
// async event: In the wxWidgets implementation, both the CI and the
// VGAW operate in the wxWidgets GUI thread.  When the user presses a
// key, wxWidgets sends a wxKeyEvent to the VGAW event handler code in
// wx.cc.  The VGAW handler then builds a BxEvent with
// type=BX_ASYNC_EVT_KEY, and fills in the bx_key and raw_scancode
// fields.  The asynchronous event is placed on the event_queue for
// the simulator, then the VGAW handler returns.  (With wxWidgets and
// many other graphical libaries, the event handler must return
// quickly because the window will not be updated until it's done.)
// Some time later, the simulator reaches the point where it checks
// for new events from the user (actually controlled by
// bx_devices_c::timer() in iodev/devices.cc) and calls
// bx_gui->handle_events(). Then all the events in the queue are
// processed by the simulator.  There is no "response" sent back to
// the originating thread.
//
// sync event: Sometimes the simulator reaches a point where it needs
// to ask the user how to proceed.  In this case, the simulator sends
// a synchronous event because it requires a response before it can
// continue.  It builds an event structure, perhaps with type
// BX_SYNC_EVT_ASK_PARAM, sends it to the user interface
// using the event handler function defined by set_notify_callback(),
// and pauses the simulation.  The user interface asks the user the
// question, and puts the answer into the BxEvent.retcode field.  The
// event handler function returns the modified BxEvent with retcode
// filled in, and the simulation continues.  The details of this
// transaction can be complicated if the simulation and CI are not
// in the same thread, but the behavior is as described.

// configuration since bochs is not running.  However it could be
// dangerous for the GUI thread to poke around in Bochs structures
// while the thread is running.  For these cases, I may have to be
// more careful and actually build get/set events and place them on
// Bochs's event queue to be processed during SIM->periodic() or

// need to discover the type of parameter so that it can use the right
// kind of graphical display.  The BxParamEvent is used for these events
// too.
// FIXME: at the moment the GUI implements the ASK_PARAM event for just
// a few parameter types.  I need to implement the event for all parameter
// types.

// Event type: BX_ASYNC_EVT_VALUE_CHANGED
//
// Asynchronous event sent from the simulator to the CI, telling it that
// some value that it (hopefully) cares about has changed.  This isn't
// being used yet, but a good example is in a debugger interface, you might
// want to maintain a reasonably current display of the PC or some other
// simulation state.  The CI would set some kind of event mask (which
// doesn't exist now of course) and then when certain values change, the
// simulator would send this event so that the CI can update.  We may need
// some kind of "flow control" since the simulator will be able to produce
// new events much faster than the gui can accept them.

// Event type: BX_ASYNC_EVT_LOG_MSG
//
// Asynchronous event from the simulator to the CI.  When a BX_PANIC,
// BX_ERROR, BX_INFO, or BX_DEBUG is found in the simulator code, this
// event type can be used to inform the CI of the condition.  There is
// no point in sending messages to the CI that will not be displayed; these
// would only slow the simulation.  So we will need some mechanism for
// choosing what kinds of events will be delivered to the CI.  Normally,
// you wouldn't want to look at the log unless something is going wrong.
// At that point, you might want to open up a window to watch the debug
// messages from one or two devices only.
//
// Idea: Except for panics that require user attention to continue, it
// might be most efficient to just append log messages to a file.
// When the user wants to look at the log messages, the gui can reopen
// the file (read only), skip to the end, and look backward for a

// skip over huge bursts of log entries without allocating memory,

// when the "action=ask" setting is used.  If the simulator runs into a
// panic, it sends a synchronous BX_SYNC_EVT_LOG_DLG to the CI to be
